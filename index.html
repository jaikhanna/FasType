<p>How fast and accurately can you type?</p>

<p>The app is not available on the AppStore yet, but you can download the code and run it on your iOS device.</p>

<p>Note that although this app runs on all iOS devices on iOS 9.0 or greater, we prefer you run it on an iPhone 6/6s/6 Plus/ 6s Plus for the best experience.</p>

<h5>
<a id="steps" class="anchor" href="#steps" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Steps:</h5>

<pre><code>1. Download the source onto your Mac.
2. Open the downloaded folder and open the file named **FasType.xcworkspace**. This should open up Xcode and you should now be able to see the project classes and folders.
3. In the Project Navigator on the left column, click on the highest directory folder named **FasType.xcodeproj** and this should open the project settings.
4. At this point, you might want to change the **Bundle Identifier** to a unique text to be able to run the app from your Mac. We suggest you change it to **com.XXXX.FasType** where **XXXX** comes from your email address - XXXX@someDomain.com.
5. You might also want to click on the **Team** dropdown and then **Add an Account...**. This will require you to enter your Apple Id and password (The app does **not** store your credentials at any point).
6. Open Terminal and cd into the downloaded project folder. 
7. Type gem which cocoapods - This should tell you if you have cocoapods installed or not. If not then run "sudo gem install cocoapods".
8. Run pod install and wait till the command finishes running.
9. Now, you can connect your device and run the app by clicking on the play/build &amp; run button in Xcode.
10. This might give you an error saying that the developer profile is not trusted. To fix this, go to your device Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Device Management-&gt;Your Apple ID-&gt;Trust "Your Apple ID"-&gt;Trust.
11. You can now go back to Xcode and run the app again. 
12. The final step - &lt;b&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/b&gt;
